# 🏎️ FastTrack-ML  
Formula 1 Data Science & Machine Learning Projects

## 📌 Overview
**FastTrack-ML** is a collection of Formula 1–focused machine learning and data science projects.  
The goal is to explore, experiment, and master different ML models using **real-world F1 telemetry, timing, and race data**.

This repository will start with small exploratory projects and grow into **full end-to-end AI systems** for prediction, strategy optimization, and race analytics.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Learn and implement a wide range of **machine learning models**:
  - Gradient Boosted Trees (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)
  - Neural Networks (TensorFlow, PyTorch)
  - Clustering Algorithms (K-Means, DBSCAN)
  - Traditional ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forests, SVM, etc.)
- Apply them to **Formula 1 datasets** from the [FastF1 API](https://docs.fastf1.dev).
- Build both **historical analysis** tools and **real-time prediction models**.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** 🐍
- **FastF1** for data collection  
- **Pandas / NumPy** for data wrangling  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly** for visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** for traditional ML  
- **XGBoost / LightGBM / CatBoost** for tree-based models  
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch** for deep learning  
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for exploration
